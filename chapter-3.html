            <h2>1. Introduction and Types of Interpersonal Communication</h2>
            <p>Interpersonal communication is the exchange of <strong>thoughts, ideas, and feelings</strong> between two
                or more people. Humans are a gregarious species, and communication is our primary tool for
                socialisation, relationship building, and collaborative achievement.</p>

            <p>Unlike mass communication or organizational communication, interpersonal communication is characterized
                by personal interaction, emotional connection, and the development of relationships. It occurs in
                various contexts including personal relationships, professional settings, casual encounters, and formal
                meetings.</p>

            <h3>The Four Types of Interpersonal Communication</h3>

            <h4>Listening</h4>
            <p><strong>Active listening</strong> is the most important but often neglected type of interpersonal
                communication. It is the cornerstone of any successful relationship, whether personal or professional.
                Active listening involves fully concentrating on the speaker, understanding their message, responding
                thoughtfully, and remembering key information.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Components:</strong> Paying attention, showing engagement through body language, providing
                feedback, deferring judgment, and responding appropriately.</p>

            <h4>Verbal Communication</h4>
            <p>Verbal communication involves the selection of language and the manner of speaking. This includes not
                just what you say, but how you say it—including word choice, tone, volume, pace, and clarity.</p>
            <p><strong>Considerations:</strong> Vocabulary level appropriate to audience, clarity of pronunciation,
                confidence in delivery, cultural appropriateness of language, and persuasiveness of arguments.</p>

            <h4>Non-Verbal Communication</h4>
            <p>Non-verbal communication is conveyed without words through <strong>gestures, postures, facial
                    expressions, pitch, tone, and even silence</strong>. Research suggests that up to 93% of
                communication effectiveness is determined by non-verbal cues.</p>
            <p><strong>Elements include:</strong> Body language (kinesics), eye contact (oculesics), personal space
                (proxemics), touch (haptics), appearance, facial expressions, and paralanguage (vocal characteristics
                beyond words).</p>

            <h4>Written Communication</h4>
            <p>Written communication involves codifying messages into a language the receiver understands. In
                interpersonal contexts, this includes emails, text messages, letters, notes, and instant messaging.</p>
            <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Provides a permanent record, allows time for thoughtful composition, can be
                reviewed and edited, suitable for complex information.</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Lacks immediate feedback, misses non-verbal cues, can be misinterpreted,
                requires literacy and language proficiency.</p>

            <h2>2. Principles of Interpersonal Communication</h2>
            <p>Understanding these fundamental principles helps explain why communication succeeds or fails in
                interpersonal contexts. Use the mnemonic <strong>"I-I-C-C"</strong> to remember them.</p>

            <h2>3. Major Theories of Interpersonal Communication</h2>
            <p>These theories provide frameworks for understanding how and why people communicate in interpersonal
                contexts. They help predict behavior and improve communication effectiveness.</p>

            <h3>A. Uncertainty Reduction Theory</h3>
            <p>Developed by Charles Berger and Richard Calabrese, this theory posits that humans are uncomfortable with
                uncertainty and actively seek predictability in initial interactions. When we meet someone new, we're
                motivated to reduce uncertainty about their attitudes, beliefs, and likely behaviors.</p>

            <p><strong>The theory suggests we use four primary strategies to reduce uncertainty:</strong></p>

            <h4>Passive Approach</h4>
            <p>Gathering information through observation without direct interaction. This includes watching how the
                person behaves in different situations, noting their interactions with others, and observing their
                reactions to events.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Before approaching a potential business partner at a networking event, you
                observe how they interact with others, their communication style, and their level of engagement.</p>

            <h4>Active Approach</h4>
            <p>Seeking information about the target person from third parties who know them. This involves asking mutual
                acquaintances, checking references, or consulting colleagues.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Before a first meeting with a new client, you ask colleagues who have worked
                with them about their preferences, communication style, and business approach.</p>

            <h4>Interactive Approach</h4>
            <p>Direct interaction through probing questions, self-disclosure, and engaged conversation. This is
                considered the most effective method as it allows for immediate clarification and relationship building.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> During an interview, asking thoughtful questions about company culture,
                expectations, and team dynamics while also sharing relevant information about yourself.</p>

            <h4>Extractive Approach</h4>
            <p>Using online media and digital resources to find information about the person. This modern addition to
                the theory reflects how technology has changed information gathering.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Reviewing someone's LinkedIn profile, professional publications, or social
                media presence before a meeting to understand their background and interests.</p>

            <p><strong>Application:</strong> This theory is particularly useful in professional contexts such as job
                interviews, client meetings, networking events, and team formation. Understanding these strategies helps
                you consciously reduce uncertainty and build more effective relationships.</p>

            <h3>B. Social Exchange Theory</h3>
            <p>Based on economic principles, this theory states that people evaluate relationships through a
                <strong>cost-benefit analysis</strong>. Relationships are maintained when perceived benefits outweigh
                perceived costs, and terminated when costs exceed benefits.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rewards:</strong> Positive outcomes from the relationship (love, support, status,
                    information, material benefits)</li>
                <li><strong>Costs:</strong> Negative aspects (time, effort, stress, sacrifices, emotional investment)
                </li>
                <li><strong>Comparison Level (CL):</strong> The standard against which we evaluate our current
                    relationship based on past experiences</li>
                <li><strong>Comparison Level for Alternatives (CLalt):</strong> Assessment of available alternative
                    relationships</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Personal Context Example</h4>
            <p>A <strong>marriage</strong> operates as a social exchange where partners remain content as long as they
                feel their efforts (time, emotional support, compromises, financial contributions) are reciprocated with
                equal or greater benefits (companionship, love, security, partnership). When one partner consistently
                perceives imbalance—giving more than receiving—dissatisfaction and conflict arise.</p>

            <h4>Professional Context Example</h4>
            <p>An <strong>employee</strong> evaluates their job through social exchange: they invest time, skills,
                effort, and loyalty. In return, they expect fair compensation, recognition, growth opportunities, and a
                positive work environment. When employees perceive that their contributions significantly exceed what
                they receive (underpaid, overworked, unrecognized), they become discontented and may seek alternative
                employment.</p>

            <p><strong>Management Application:</strong> Understanding social exchange theory helps managers ensure
                equitable treatment, provide adequate rewards for effort, and maintain positive workplace relationships.
                Regular feedback, fair compensation, recognition programs, and career development opportunities help
                maintain favorable exchange ratios.</p>

            <h2>4. Team Communication</h2>
            <p>Effective team communication is fundamental to organizational success. Understanding the distinction
                between teams and groups is essential for building high-performing units.</p>

            <h3>Team vs. Group</h3>
            <p><strong>Team:</strong> A collection of individuals with <strong>complementary skills</strong> working
                collaboratively towards a common, shared objective. Team members are interdependent, share
                accountability, and succeed or fail together.</p>
            <p><strong>Group:</strong> Individuals who coordinate efforts primarily for individual goals. While they may
                work in proximity, their success is measured independently rather than collectively.</p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A surgical team (surgeon, anesthesiologist, nurses) must work in perfect
                coordination for patient safety—this is a team. A group of sales representatives in the same office may
                share resources but compete for individual quotas—this is a group.</p>

            <h3>Strategies to Improve Team Communication</h3>

            <h4>Open-Door Policy</h4>
            <p>This policy encourages employees to share ideas, concerns, and feedback with management without barriers
                or fear of repercussion. It creates psychological safety and promotes transparency.</p>
            <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Leaders should designate specific times when they're available, respond
                promptly to inquiries, maintain confidentiality when appropriate, and act on feedback received. The
                policy only works if employees feel safe and see tangible responses to their input.</p>
            <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Early problem identification, increased employee engagement, better
                decision-making through diverse input, stronger trust between management and staff.</p>

            <h4>Constructive Feedback</h4>
            <p>Effective feedback must be a <strong>two-way, receptive process</strong> rather than one-directional
                criticism. It should focus on behaviors and outcomes rather than personal characteristics.</p>
            <p><strong>Best Practices:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Be specific and timely (give feedback close to the event)</li>
                <li>Balance positive and constructive elements</li>
                <li>Focus on observable behaviors, not assumptions about intentions</li>
                <li>Offer actionable suggestions for improvement</li>
                <li>Create dialogue by asking for the other person's perspective</li>
                <li>Follow up to acknowledge progress</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The SBI Model (Situation-Behavior-Impact):</strong> Describe the specific situation, the
                observable behavior, and the impact it had. Example: "In yesterday's client meeting [situation], when
                you interrupted the client twice [behavior], they seemed frustrated and cut the meeting short [impact]."
            </p>

            <h4>Team-Building Exercises</h4>
            <p>Structured activities, outings, and collaborative games help team members bond, reveal hidden talents,
                build trust, and rejuvenate. These activities move relationships beyond purely transactional
                professional interactions.</p>
            <p><strong>Types of Activities:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Problem-solving challenges:</strong> Escape rooms, puzzle-solving exercises</li>
                <li><strong>Physical activities:</strong> Sports tournaments, adventure courses, hiking</li>
                <li><strong>Creative exercises:</strong> Improv workshops, collaborative art projects</li>
                <li><strong>Social events:</strong> Team dinners, volunteer activities, celebration gatherings</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Improved communication, discovery of complementary skills, breaking down
                hierarchical barriers, increased empathy, stronger informal networks, reduced stress.</p>

            <h4>Managing Personnel Diversity</h4>
            <p>In multicultural and diverse teams, leaders must actively help members understand and appreciate
                different accents, communication styles, slang, cultural beliefs, work approaches, and time
                orientations.</p>
            <p><strong>Strategies:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Conduct cultural awareness training</li>
                <li>Establish clear communication protocols and norms</li>
                <li>Encourage questions and clarification without judgment</li>
                <li>Create opportunities for informal cross-cultural interaction</li>
                <li>Address misunderstandings promptly and educationally</li>
                <li>Celebrate cultural diversity through recognition and events</li>
                <li>Use visual aids and written summaries to overcome language barriers</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Negotiation Strategies</h2>
            <p>Negotiation is the dialogue and strategic process used to reach an agreement when parties have both
                common and conflicting interests. Effective negotiation is essential in business deals, conflict
                resolution, salary discussions, vendor agreements, and interpersonal relationships.</p>

            <h3>BATNA: Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement</h3>
            <p>Developed by Roger Fisher and William Ury in their book "Getting to Yes," BATNA represents the
                <strong>best deal available if the current negotiation fails</strong>. It's your walk-away option and
                determines your negotiating power.
            </p>

            <h4>Why BATNA Matters</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Determines negotiating power:</strong> A strong BATNA gives you leverage; a weak BATNA makes
                    you vulnerable</li>
                <li><strong>Prevents bad agreements:</strong> Knowing your BATNA helps you avoid accepting deals worse
                    than your alternatives</li>
                <li><strong>Provides confidence:</strong> Understanding your options reduces anxiety and improves
                    performance</li>
                <li><strong>Sets your reservation point:</strong> The worst acceptable outcome before you walk away</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>How to Develop Your BATNA</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>List all possible alternatives if this negotiation fails</li>
                <li>Evaluate each alternative realistically</li>
                <li>Select the best alternative (this is your BATNA)</li>
                <li>Try to improve your BATNA before and during negotiation</li>
                <li>Calculate your reservation point based on your BATNA</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong> You're negotiating a job offer for ₹12 lakhs per year. Your BATNA might be: (1)
                staying in your current job at ₹10 lakhs, (2) another pending offer at ₹11 lakhs, or (3) freelancing
                with estimated income of ₹9 lakhs. Your BATNA is the second offer at ₹11 lakhs, so you won't accept less
                than that from this negotiation.</p>

            <h3>Key Negotiation Principles</h3>

                <li><strong>Separate people from the problem:</strong> Attack issues, not personalities</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on interests, not positions:</strong> Understand underlying needs</li>
                <li><strong>Generate options for mutual gain:</strong> Brainstorm creative solutions</li>
                <li><strong>Insist on objective criteria:</strong> Use market standards, precedents, or expert opinions
                </li>
                <li><strong>Know your ZOPA:</strong> Zone of Possible Agreement—the range where agreement is possible

            <h2>6. Conflict Resolution and Management</h2>
            <p>Conflict arises from <strong>incompatible goals, scarcity of resources, differing values, or
                    misunderstandings</strong>. While often viewed negatively, conflict can be constructive when managed
                properly, leading to innovation, clarification of issues, and stronger relationships.</p>

            <h3>Types of Conflict</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Task Conflict:</strong> Disagreement about work content, goals, or procedures</li>
                <li><strong>Relationship Conflict:</strong> Interpersonal incompatibilities, personality clashes</li>
                <li><strong>Process Conflict:</strong> Disagreement about how work should be accomplished</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Conflict:</strong> Competition for limited resources (time, budget, personnel)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Communication Strategies for Conflict Resolution</h3>

            <h4>Watch Tone and Pitch</h4>
            <p>Volume and tone significantly impact conflict escalation or de-escalation. An interesting phenomenon: if
                you <strong>lower your volume during a heated argument, the other party is often compelled to do the
                    same</strong>. This creates a psychological mirror effect that reduces tension.</p>
            <p><strong>Additional techniques:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Speak slowly and deliberately (rushing signals aggression)</li>
                <li>Maintain a calm, even tone (avoid sarcasm or condescension)</li>
                <li>Use pauses strategically (allows emotions to settle)</li>
                <li>Monitor your facial expressions (they should match your conciliatory words)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>"I" Statements vs. "You" Statements</h4>
            <p>This is one of the most powerful communication techniques for conflict resolution.</p>

            <p><strong>Avoid "You" Statements:</strong> These sound accusatory and make the other person defensive. They
                focus on blame rather than resolution.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Why did you miss the deadline?"</li>
                <li>"You never listen to my suggestions."</li>
                <li>"You're always late to meetings."</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Use "I" Statements:</strong> These express your feelings and needs without attacking. They take
                ownership of your perspective and invite dialogue.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"I felt concerned when the deadline was missed because it affected our client relationship."</li>
                <li>"I feel frustrated when my suggestions aren't acknowledged because I want to contribute to our
                    success."</li>
                <li>"I feel stressed when meetings start late because it disrupts my schedule."</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>"I" Statement Formula:</strong> "I feel [emotion] when [behavior/situation] because
                [impact/reason]."</p>

            <h4>Accept Responsibility</h4>
            <p>Admitting mistakes graciously is a leadership trait that de-escalates situations immediately. It
                demonstrates maturity, builds trust, and models the behavior you want from others.</p>
            <p><strong>Effective apology components:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Acknowledge the specific mistake clearly</li>
                <li>Express genuine understanding of the impact</li>
                <li>Take full responsibility without excuses or deflection</li>
                <li>Propose concrete steps to prevent recurrence</li>
                <li>Ask what you can do to make amends</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> "I made an error in the budget calculations that caused delays in approval. I
                understand this created problems for your team's planning. I take full responsibility and have now
                implemented a double-check system. How can I help mitigate the impact on your timeline?"</p>

            <h2>7. Mentoring and Appraisals</h2>
            <p>Both mentoring and appraisals are critical interpersonal communication contexts that significantly impact
                career development and organizational effectiveness.</p>

            <h3>Mentoring</h3>
            <p>Mentoring is a developmental relationship where an experienced professional (the <strong>mentor</strong>)
                guides and supports a less experienced individual (the <strong>mentee</strong>) in their career growth,
                skill development, and professional navigation.</p>

            <h4>Characteristics of Effective Mentoring</h4>
            <p><strong>First-Person Communication:</strong> Effective mentors speak in the <strong>first person</strong>
                to show ownership of their advice and experiences. This personalizes the guidance and makes it more
                relatable.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Instead of: "People should network more."</li>
                <li>Say: "I found that dedicating two hours a week to networking significantly advanced my career."</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Key Mentoring Behaviors:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Active Listening:</strong> Understanding mentee's goals, concerns, and aspirations</li>
                <li><strong>Sharing Experience:</strong> Relating relevant personal stories and lessons learned</li>
                <li><strong>Providing Resources:</strong> Connecting mentees with opportunities, contacts, and
                    information</li>
                <li><strong>Constructive Challenge:</strong> Encouraging mentees to step outside comfort zones</li>
                <li><strong>Sponsorship:</strong> Advocating for the mentee in their absence</li>
                <li><strong>Modeling Behavior:</strong> Demonstrating professional standards and ethical conduct</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Types of Mentoring</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Career Mentoring:</strong> Focus on professional advancement and skill development</li>
                <li><strong>Psychosocial Mentoring:</strong> Emotional support, confidence building, work-life balance
                </li>
                <li><strong>Formal Mentoring:</strong> Structured programs with assigned pairings</li>
                <li><strong>Informal Mentoring:</strong> Organic relationships that develop naturally</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Performance Appraisals</h3>
            <p>Performance appraisals are systematic evaluations of employee performance, providing feedback on
                accomplishments, areas for improvement, and future development needs.</p>

            <h4>Critical Communication Principles for Appraisals</h4>

            <p><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Appraisals must be strictly <strong>confidential</strong> and conducted
                in private settings. Public feedback, especially negative, causes humiliation, damages trust, and
                creates lasting resentment.</p>

            <p><strong>One-to-One Format:</strong> Performance discussions should occur in individual meetings, never in
                group settings. This allows for honest dialogue, reduces defensiveness, and maintains dignity.</p>

            <p><strong>Two-Way Dialogue:</strong> Managers should listen carefully to employee perspectives, concerns,
                and self-assessments. This prevents resentment and attrition by making employees feel heard and valued.
            </p>

            <h4>Effective Appraisal Practices</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Both parties should prepare with specific examples and documentation
                </li>
                <li><strong>Regular Frequency:</strong> Formal appraisals annually, informal feedback ongoing</li>
                <li><strong>Balanced Feedback:</strong> Acknowledge strengths before addressing development areas</li>
                <li><strong>Specific Examples:</strong> Use concrete instances rather than generalizations</li>
                <li><strong>Future Focus:</strong> Emphasize development plans and growth opportunities</li>
                <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Record agreements, goals, and action plans in writing</li>
                <li><strong>Follow-up:</strong> Schedule check-ins to monitor progress and provide support</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Common Appraisal Mistakes to Avoid</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Recency Bias:</strong> Overweighting recent events while ignoring earlier performance</li>
                <li><strong>Halo/Horn Effect:</strong> Letting one trait color entire evaluation</li>
                <li><strong>Comparison Trap:</strong> Comparing employees to each other rather than to standards</li>
                <li><strong>Sandwich Approach Overuse:</strong> Predictable pattern of positive-negative-positive
                    feedback loses impact</li>
                <li><strong>Vague Feedback:</strong> General statements like "good job" without specifics</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8. Digital and Social Media Communication</h2>
            <p>Digital and social media have fundamentally transformed interpersonal communication, creating new
                opportunities and challenges for personal and professional interaction.</p>

            <h3>Advantages of Digital Communication</h3>

            <h4>Cost-Effectiveness</h4>
            <p>Digital platforms dramatically reduce communication costs compared to traditional media. Premium brands
                like <strong>Rolls Royce and Zara</strong> rely heavily on social media because it provides global reach
                at a fraction of traditional advertising costs.</p>
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A single social media post can reach millions for minimal cost</li>
                <li>Email marketing costs pennies compared to direct mail</li>
                <li>Video conferencing eliminates travel expenses for meetings</li>
                <li>Customer service through social platforms reduces support costs</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Direct Feedback and Engagement</h4>
            <p>Social media enables immediate, direct interaction between brands and consumers, organizations and
                stakeholders, or individuals and their networks. This two-way communication provides:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real-time feedback:</strong> Instant reactions to products, services, or content</li>
                <li><strong>Customer insights:</strong> Understanding preferences, pain points, and desires</li>
                <li><strong>Community building:</strong> Creating engaged audiences around shared interests</li>
                <li><strong>Rapid response:</strong> Addressing concerns or capitalizing on trends quickly</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Additional Advantages</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Global Reach:</strong> Connect with audiences worldwide simultaneously</li>
                <li><strong>Targeted Communication:</strong> Precise audience segmentation and personalization</li>
                <li><strong>Measurable Impact:</strong> Analytics provide detailed performance metrics</li>
                <li><strong>Multimedia Capabilities:</strong> Combine text, images, video, and interactive elements</li>
                <li><strong>Permanence and Searchability:</strong> Content remains accessible and discoverable</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Challenges of Digital Communication</h3>

            <h4>Content Creation Demands</h4>
            <p>Creating engaging content frequently is extremely difficult because <strong>human creativity cannot be
                    forced or sustained indefinitely</strong>. The pressure for constant content production leads to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Burnout:</strong> Mental exhaustion from continuous creative demands</li>
                <li><strong>Quality Decline:</strong> Rushed content that lacks depth or originality</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Recycling ideas when fresh inspiration is lacking</li>
                <li><strong>Authenticity Loss:</strong> Forced posting that feels inauthentic to audiences</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Solution Strategies:</strong> Content calendars, batch creation, user-generated content, curated
                content, team collaboration, and realistic posting schedules.</p>

            <h4>Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Concerns</h4>
            <p>Communicators must be extremely careful with <strong>Intellectual Property Rights</strong> when using
                third-party content, including images, music, videos, text, and logos.</p>

            <p><strong>Common IPR Violations:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using copyrighted images without permission or licensing</li>
                <li>Incorporating music in videos without rights clearance</li>
                <li>Reproducing articles or substantial text portions without attribution</li>
                <li>Using brand logos or trademarks without authorization</li>
                <li>Sharing or reposting others' creative work without credit</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Best Practices for IPR Compliance:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create original content whenever possible</li>
                <li>Use royalty-free or Creative Commons licensed materials</li>
                <li>Obtain proper permissions and licenses for third-party content</li>
                <li>Provide clear attribution and credits</li>
                <li>Understand fair use limitations (they're narrower than most people think)</li>
                <li>When in doubt, consult legal counsel or don't use the content</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Additional Digital Communication Challenges</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Misinterpretation Risk:</strong> Absence of non-verbal cues increases misunderstanding</li>
                <li><strong>Permanence and Virality:</strong> Mistakes can spread rapidly and remain accessible
                    indefinitely</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy Concerns:</strong> Data security and information sharing risks</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Divide:</strong> Not everyone has equal access or digital literacy</li>
                <li><strong>Information Overload:</strong> Excessive messages competing for attention</li>
                <li><strong>Authenticity Verification:</strong> Difficulty distinguishing genuine from fake content</li>
                <li><strong>Platform Algorithm Changes:</strong> Sudden shifts in visibility and reach</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Professional Digital Communication Guidelines</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintain consistent professional tone across platforms</li>
                <li>Think before posting—remember the irreversibility principle</li>
                <li>Separate personal and professional accounts when appropriate</li>
                <li>Respond promptly but thoughtfully to messages and comments</li>
                <li>Handle negative feedback professionally and publicly when appropriate</li>
                <li>Stay updated on platform policies and best practices</li>
                <li>Protect sensitive information and respect confidentiality</li>
                <li>Use appropriate platforms for different types of communication</li>
            </ul>
