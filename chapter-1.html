            <h2>1. Introduction to Communication</h2>
            <p>Communication is derived from the Latin word <em>communicare</em>, meaning <strong>'to share' or 'make
                    common'</strong>. It is the process of sharing and understanding meaning. In a business environment,
                it is the mechanism that ensures an organisation functions smoothly by addressing internal and external
                factors.</p>

            <h3>Daily Life Example: Meaning and Context</h3>
            <p>In the <strong>US</strong>, the term <strong>"bike"</strong> typically refers to a
                <strong>bicycle</strong>, whereas in <strong>India</strong>, it almost always refers to a
                <strong>motorbike</strong>. This demonstrates how meaning is tied to cultural context.

            <h2>2. The Communication Process</h2>
            <p>Communication is a cyclical process involving multiple actors, processes, and potential interference. The
                cycle completes when feedback returns to the original sender.</p>

            <h3>Actors</h3>
            <p><strong>Sender:</strong> The individual or entity initiating the communication by formulating a thought
                or idea to share.</p>
            <p><strong>Receiver:</strong> The individual or entity who receives and interprets the transmitted message.
            </p>

            <h3>Processes</h3>
            <p><strong>Encoding:</strong> The sender converts thoughts into communicable form using language, symbols,
                gestures, or other sign systems.</p>
            <p><strong>Message:</strong> The encoded content itself, which can be verbal, written, visual, or non-verbal
                in nature.</p>
            <p><strong>Channel:</strong> The medium through which the message travels. Examples include email,
                face-to-face conversation, phone calls, or video conferencing.</p>
            <p><strong>Decoding:</strong> The receiver interprets the message based on their own knowledge, experience,
                and cultural context.</p>
            <p><strong>Feedback:</strong> The receiver's response, which may be verbal, non-verbal, or written. Feedback
                transforms the receiver into a sender, creating a cyclical exchange.</p>

            <h3>Interference</h3>
            <p><strong>Noise:</strong> Any factor that distorts or impedes the message. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Physical noise: Background sounds, poor audio quality, visual distractions</li>
                <li>Psychological noise: Preconceptions, biases, emotional states</li>
                <li>Semantic noise: Jargon, ambiguous terms, language barriers</li>
                <li>Technical noise: Equipment failure, connectivity issues</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Cyclical Flow</h3>
            <p>Sender encodes message → Message transmitted through channel → Receiver decodes message → Feedback
                encoded by receiver → Original sender decodes feedback. Noise can occur at any stage of this cycle.</p>
